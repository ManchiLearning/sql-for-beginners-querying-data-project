# SQL for Beginners: Querying Data Guided Project

This repository hosts the materials covered in the Coursera Project Network's guided project: ["SQL for Beginners: Querying Data"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/sql-for-beginners--querying-data)

In this project, you will learn:

* Use `SELECT` Statements to select columns of datasets
* Apply conditions to a SQL query using the `WHERE` clause
* Group a dataset by one or more columns.with the `GROUP BY` clause


## Scenario

**Your Role: Sales Executive**

You are a sales executive of an import-export company called "Northwind Traders", which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software you oversee contains a database with several tables for customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.

## Project Goal

Your goal is ultimately to analyze sales data for a 3-month period. Before analyzing the data, you need to extract it from the database using SQL. Your first job, the goal of this project is to learn how to query data from the Northwind Database using SQL.

## Guided Project Tasks

#### Task #1: Use SELECT Statements to select columns
Learn how to SELECT statements to select one or multiple columns of database tables.

#### Task #2: Use the WHERE clause to apply conditions
Learn how to apply conditions to a SQL query using the WHERE clause.

#### Task #3: Apply GROUP BY to group data by columns
Learn how to group a dataset by one or more columns with the GROUP BY clause.

### Practice Quiz
Q&A on SELECT, WHERE and GROUP BY clauses in SQL

### Capstone Activity
Use basic SQL clauses such as SELECT, GROUP BY and WHERE to query data from the database as a Sales executive of Northwind Traders
